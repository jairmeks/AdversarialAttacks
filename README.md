#AdversarialAttacks
Repo for collaboration on Image Perturbation and Adversarial Attacks

The attack scripts in this repository are intended to be run against a facial recognition image classifier.

We used a classifier trained on the Yale B Cropped Database using the the Inception V3 architecture.

Each imageAttack script requires that the label_image2.py and classify.py scripts be available in the working directory. The imageDualAttack.py script requires imageAttack2Pixels.py and imageAttackAllPixels.py.
